Project Title: Sentiment-Based Trader Performance Analysis

Author: Kavita Kohli

Objective:
This project explores the relationship between market sentiment (Fear-Greed Index) and trader performance. The goal is to analyze how different market moods influence trading activity, profit/loss, and volume.

Project Overview:
1. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two datasets:
   - Trader transaction data
   - Fear-Greed sentiment data

2. Merged both datasets based on date after dropping null values.

3. Conducted EDA on the merged dataset to identify trends in:
   - Trade Value
   - PnL (Profit and Loss)
   - Trading activity during different sentiment phases (Fear, Greed, etc.)

4. Performed hypothesis testing using:
   - ANOVA
   - Chi-Square
   - Pearson correlation
   - T-test

5. Derived insights and patterns to support smarter trading strategies.

Conclusion:
The analysis revealed that trading behavior and profitability are significantly influenced by market sentiment. Trades made during 'Fear' and 'Extreme Greed' phases showed higher average profits, while neutral and extremely fearful periods had lower performance. These insights can be used to enhance future trading strategies.
